### Lesson outline  

**A. Early Ideas about Heredity**  
1. <span style="color:red"><u>Heredity</u></span> is the passing of traits from parents to offspring.  
2. In the 1850s, <span style="color:red"><u>Gregor Mendel</u></span>, an Austrian monk, performed experiments that helped answer questions about how traits are inherited.  
3. <span style="color:red"><u>Genetics</u></span> is the study of how traits pass from parents to offspring.  
 
**B. Mendel’s Experimental Methods**  
1. Pea plants were ideal for genetic studies because they <span style="color:red"><u>reproduce</u></span> quickly; they have easily observed <span style="color:red"><u>traits</u></span>; and the experimenter can control which pairs of plants <span style="color:red"><u>reproduce</u></span>.  
2. Mendel controlled which plants <span style="color:red"><u>pollinated</u></span> other plants.  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;a. When a(n) <span style="color:red"><u>true-breeding</u></span> plant self-pollinates, it always produces offspring with traits that match the parent.    
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;b. By <span style="color:red"><u>cross-pollinating</u></span> plants himself, Mendel was able to select which plants pollinated other plants.    
3. With each cross-pollination Mendel did, he recorded the traits that appeared in the <span style="color:red"><u>offspring</u></span>.    

**C. Mendel’s Results**  
1. Mendel’s crosses between true-breeding plants with purple flowers produced plants  with only <span style="color:red"><u>purple</u></span> flowers. Crosses between true-breeding plants with white flowers produced plants with only <span style="color:red"><u>white</u></span> flowers.  
2. Crosses between true-breeding plants with purple flowers and true-breeding plants with white flowers produced plants with only <span style="color:red"><u>purple</u></span> flowers.  
3. The first–generation purple-flowering plants are called <span style="color:red"><u>hybrid</u></span> plants.  
4. When Mendel cross-pollinated two hybrid plants, the trait that had disappeared in the first generation always <span style="color:red"><u>reappeared</u></span> in the second generation.  
5. Mendel analyzed the data from many experiments on seven different <span style="color:red"><u>traits</u></span>. He always noted a 3:1 <span style="color:red"><u>ratio</u></span>; for example, purple flowers grew from hybrid crosses <span style="color:red"><u>three</u></span> times as often as white flowers.
