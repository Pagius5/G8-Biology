## Lecture 5: Meiosis-1

### Lesson outline  
![](./img/nonsis.png)  

**D. The Phases of Meiosis**  
1. Meiosis involves two divisions of the nucleus and the <span style="color:red"><u>cytoplasm</u></span>. These divisions, known as meiosis I and meiosis II, result in four haploid cells.  
2. During <span style="color:red"><u>interphase</u></span>, the reproductive cell grows and duplicates its chromosomes.  
3. During meiosis I, each pair of duplicated homologous chromosomes <span style="color:red"><u>separates</u></span>.  
4. After meiosis I, the two cells formed during this stage go through a second division of the <span style="color:red"><u>nucleus</u></span> and cytoplasm called meiosis II. During meiosis II, sister <span style="color:red"><u>chromatids</u></span> separate to produce four haploid cells.  

**E. Why is meiosis important?**  
1. Meiosis forms sex cells with the correct haploid number of <span style="color:red"><u>chromosomes</u></span>. This maintains the correct <span style="color:red"><u>diploid</u></span> number of chromosomes in organisms when sex cells join. Meiosis creates genetic variation by producing <span style="color:red"><u>haploid</u></span> cells.
