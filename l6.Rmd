**Short Answer Questions**  
(6 points maximum) One point for each of the following:  

* <u>Correct description of meiosis</u>  
Germ cell is a diploid cell, and goes through meiosis to produce gametes, which are haploid cells.  
* <u>DNA replicates in interphase</u>  
DNA replicates in interphase, and each chromosome then has a pair of identical sister chromatids.  
* <u>Homologous chromosomes pair in prophase I</u>  
* <u>Spindle fibers move chromosomes pairs to poles in anaphase I</u>  
In the end of meiosis I, two daughter cells are produced, and their chromosomes are halved.  
  
* <u>Two cycles/rounds of division in meiosis</u>  
* <u>No additional replication before meiosis II</u>  
* <u>Sister chromatids separate to poles in anaphase II</u>  
Separation of sister chromatids doesn't change the number of chromsomes. The daughter cells are still haploid cells.
* <u>1 germ cell yields 4 gametes</u>  
4 gametes, which are haploid cells, are produced in the end of meiosis.
