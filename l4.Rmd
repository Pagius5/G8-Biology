### Lesson outline

**A. What is sexual reproduction?**  
1. <span style="color:red"><u>Sexual reproduction</u></span> produces an offspring when genetic materials from two 
different sex cells combine.  
a. The female sex cell, a(n) <span style="color:red"><u>egg</u></span>, forms in an ovary.  
b. The male sex cell, a(n) <span style="color:red"><u>sperm</u></span>, forms in a testis.   
2. During a process called <span style="color:red"><u>fertilization</u></span>, an egg cell and a sperm cell join together. The 
new cell that forms is called a(n) <span style="color:red"><u>zygote</u></span>.  

**B. Diploid Cells**  
1. Organisms that reproduce sexually make two kinds of cells—<span style="color:red"><u>body</u></span> cells and sex cells.  
2. Body cells are <span style="color:red"><u>diploid</u></span>; they have pairs of chromosomes.  
3. If a zygote has too many or too few <span style="color:red"><u>chromosomes</u></span>, it will not develop properly.  
4. Different organisms have different <span style="color:red"><u>numbers</u></span> of chromosomes.  
5. <span style="color:red"><u>Homologous chromosomes</u></span> are pairs of chromosomes that have genes for the same traits arranged in the same order.  

**C. Haploid Cells**  
1. Sex cells are <span style="color:red"><u>haploid</u></span>; they have only one chromosome from each pair of chromosomes.  
2. In <span style="color:red"><u>meiosis</u></span>, one diploid cell divides and makes four haploid cells.

13. A zygote is <span style="color:red">a new cell</span> that forms when <u>an egg cell and a sperm cell join during fertilization</u>.

14. A diploid cell has <span style="color:red">pairs of chromosomes</span> and is located in body cells. A haploid cell has only <span style="color:red">one set of chromosomes</span> and is located in sex cells.  
(Hint: a pair or chromosomes/two sets of chromosomes vs. one chromosome from each pair/one set of chromsomes)

### Extension  
<font size=5>**How to write a definition?**</font>  

A formal definition is based upon a concise, logical pattern that includes as much information as it can within a minimum amount of space. The primary reason to include definitions in your writing is to avoid misunderstanding with your audience. A formal definition consists of three parts:

1. The **term** (word or phrase) to be defined  
2. The **class** of object or concept to which the term belongs  
3. The **differentiating characteristics** that distinguish it from all others of its class  

For example:  

* Water (term) is a liquid (class) made up of molecules of hydrogen and oxygen in the ratio of 2 to 1 (differentiating characteristics).  
* Comic books (term) are sequential and narrative publications (class) consisting of illustrations, captions, dialogue balloons, and often focus on super-powered heroes (differentiating characteristics).  
* Astronomy (term) is a branch of scientific study (class) primarily concerned with celestial objects inside and outside of the earth's atmosphere (differentiating characteristics).
