### Lesson outline

**A. What is sexual reproduction?**  
1. <u>Sexual reproduction</u> produces an offspring when genetic materials from two 
different sex cells combine.  
a. The female sex cell, a(n) <u>egg</u>, forms in an ovary.  
b. The male sex cell, a(n) <u>sperm</u>, forms in a testis.   
2. During a process called <u>fertilization</u>, an egg cell and a sperm cell join together. The 
new cell that forms is called a(n) <u>zygote</u>.  

**B. Diploid Cells**  
1. Organisms that reproduce sexually make two kinds of cellsâ€”<u>body</u> cells and sex cells.  
2. Body cells are <u>diploid</u>; they have pairs of chromosomes.  
3. If a zygote has too many or too few <u>chromosomes</u>, it will not develop properly.  
4. Different organisms have different <u>numbers</u> of chromosomes.  
5. <u>Homologous chromosomes</u> are pairs of chromosomes that have genes for the same traits arranged in the same order.  

**C. Haploid Cells**  
1. Sex cells are <u>haploid</u>; they have only one chromosome from each pair of chromosomes.  
2. In <u>meiosis</u>, one diploid cell divides and makes four haploid cells.
