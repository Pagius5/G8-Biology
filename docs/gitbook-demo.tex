\textbf{A. What is sexual reproduction?}\\
1. {Sexual reproduction} produces an offspring when genetic materials from two
different sex cells combine.\\
a. The female sex cell, a(n) {egg}, forms in an ovary.\\
b. The male sex cell, a(n) {sperm}, forms in a testis.\\
2. During a process called {fertilization}, an egg cell and a sperm cell join together. The
new cell that forms is called a(n) {zygote}.

\textbf{B. Diploid Cells}\\
1. Organisms that reproduce sexually make two kinds of cells---{body} cells and sex cells.\\
2. Body cells are {diploid}; they have pairs of chromosomes.\\
3. If a zygote has too many or too few {chromosomes}, it will not develop properly.\\
4. Different organisms have different {numbers} of chromosomes.\\
5. {Homologous chromosomes} are pairs of chromosomes that have genes for the same traits arranged in the same order.

\textbf{C. Haploid Cells}\\
1. Sex cells are {haploid}; they have only one chromosome from each pair of chromosomes.\\
2. In {meiosis}, one diploid cell divides and makes four haploid cells.

\textbf{How to write a definition?}

A formal definition is based upon a concise, logical pattern that includes as much information as it can within a minimum amount of space. The primary reason to include definitions in your writing is to avoid misunderstanding with your audience. A formal definition consists of three parts:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The \textbf{term} (word or phrase) to be defined\\
\item
  The \textbf{class} of object or concept to which the term belongs\\
\item
  The \textbf{differentiating characteristics} that distinguish it from all others of its class
\end{enumerate}

For example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Water (term) is a liquid (class) made up of molecules of hydrogen and oxygen in the ratio of 2 to 1 (differentiating characteristics).\\
\item
  Comic books (term) are sequential and narrative publications (class) consisting of illustrations, captions, dialogue balloons, and often focus on super-powered heroes (differentiating characteristics).\\
\item
  Astronomy (term) is a branch of scientific study (class) primarily concerned with celestial objects inside and outside of the earth's atmosphere (differentiating characteristics).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{D. The Phases of Meiosis}\\
1. Meiosis involves two divisions of the nucleus and the {cytoplasm}. These divisions, known as meiosis I and meiosis II, result in four haploid cells.\\
2. During {interphase}, the reproductive cell grows and duplicates its chromosomes.\\
3. During meiosis I, each pair of duplicated homologous chromosomes {separates}.\\
4. After meiosis I, the two cells formed during this stage go through a second division of the {nucleus} and cytoplasm called meiosis II. During meiosis II, sister {chromatids} separate to produce four haploid cells.

\textbf{E. Why is meiosis important?}\\
1. Meiosis forms sex cells with the correct haploid number of {chromosomes}. This maintains the correct {diploid} number of chromosomes in organisms when sex cells join. Meiosis creates genetic variation by producing {haploid} cells.

\item
  Correct description of meiosis\\
  Germ cell is a diploid cell, and goes through meiosis to produce gametes, which are haploid cells.\\

  Two cycles/rounds of division in meiosis\\
\item
  No additional replication before meiosis II\\
\item
  Sister chromatids separate to poles in anaphase II\\
  Separation of sister chromatids doesn't change the number of chromsomes. The daughter cells are still haploid cells.

\textbf{F. How do mitosis and meiosis differ?}\\
1. During {mitosis} and cell division, a body cell and its nucleus divide once and produce two identical cells.\\
2. During {meiosis}, a reproductive cell and its nucleus divide twice and produce four cells----two pairs of identical haploid cells.

\textbf{G. Advantages of Sexual Reproduction}\\
1. Sexual reproduction produces {offspring} that have a new combination of DNA. This results in genetic {variation} among individuals.\\
2. Genetic variation gives individuals within a population slight differences that might be an advantage if the {environment} changes.\\
3. {Selective breeding} has been used to develop desirable traits in plants and animals.

\textbf{H. Disadvantages of Sexual Reproduction}\\
1. One disadvantage of sexual reproduction is that organisms have to grow and develop until they are mature enough to produce {sex} cells.\\
2. Another disadvantage is that searching for a mate takes time and energy and might expose individuals to predators, {diseases}, or harsh environmental conditions.

Compare and contrast meiosis and mitosis and cell division
\includegraphics{./img/mitosis-meiosis.png}

\textbf{Explain} why genetic variation and selective breeding are advantages of sexual reproduction.\\
\textbf{Genetic variation}: Instead of being exact genetic copies of parents, members of the same species have different traits, which enable some of them to survive environmental changes.\\
\textbf{Selective breeding}: The process of choosing and breeding individuals with desirable traits allows breeders to create offspring with those traits.

\textbf{Identify} two main disadvantages of sexual reproduction.\\
1. takes time and takes energy\\
2. sexual reproduction is limited by certain factors (For example, fertilization cannot take place during pregnancy, which can last as long as two years in some mammals.)

\textbf{Explain} how the process of meiosis relates to the way in which a child resembles but is not an exact copy of his or her parents.\\
Observable characteristics in a child, such as \textbf{eye color, hair type and color, the shapes of facial features, and height}, resemble those of his or her parents, because the child \textbf{inherits portions of DNA from each parent}. A child is not a exact copy of his or her parents because the child \textbf{does not carry identical DNA to either parent}.

\textbf{Multiple Choice Questions}\\
1. D\\
2. C\\
(Hint: Crossing over)

\textbf{Short Answer Questions}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Organism: correct organism that produces sexually\\
\item
  Mode: two different parents / egg and sperm combine in fertilization / gametes (1n) combine to form zygote (2n) / fertilization is random\\
\item
  Advantage: increase genetic variations
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Enrichment}\\
1. For many generations, {native plants that were resistant to disease and pests} survived and reproduced. The resistant traits were passed on to their offspring. Meanwhile, {those native plants that were not resistant to disease and pests} died off. Eventually, the population of native plants was made up mainly of resistant plants.\\
2. Possible answers:\\
Preserve all: Many plants that have no current known value might have important uses in the future. Saving plants that aren't useful to people is still necessary because other organisms might depend upon these plants for survival.\\
Preserve some: Because of budget restrictions, some plants might be targeted for preservation and others are allowed to become extinct. In this situation, it would be best to determine which plants are likely to be useful to people.

\textbf{A. What is asexual reproduction?}\\
1. In {asexual reproduction}, one parent organism produces offspring without meiosis and fertilization.\\
2. Because the offspring of asexual reproduction inherit all their DNA from one parent, they are genetically {identical} to each other and their parent.

\textbf{B. Types of Asexual Reproduction}\\
1. Cell division in prokaryotes is known as {\textbf{fission}}.\\
2. During fission, DNA is {copied} and the cell splits to form two identical offspring. The original cell no longer exists.\\
3. Many unicellular {eukaryotes} reproduce by {\textbf{mitotic cell division}}. In this type of asexual reproduction, an organism forms two offspring through mitosis and {cell division}.\\
4. In {\textbf{budding}}, a new organism grows on the body of its parent by mitosis and cell division. When the bud becomes large enough, it can break from the parent and live on its own.\\
5. {\textbf{Regeneration}} occurs when an offspring grows from a piece of its parent.\\
a. Sea stars, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and planarians can {reproduce} through regeneration.\\
b. Many animals can {regenerate} damaged or lost body parts. This is not reproduction; {new individuals} are not produced.\\
6. {\textbf{Vegetative reproduction}} is a form of asexual reproduction in which offspring grow from a part of a parent plant.\\
7. {\textbf{Cloning}} is a type of asexual reproduction developed by scientists and performed in laboratories. It produces {identical} individuals from a cell or from a cluster of cells taken from a multicellular organism.\\
8. Using a cloning method called {tissue culture}, plant growers and scientists use a meristem to make a copy of a plant with desirable traits.\\
9. Because all of a clone's {chromosomes} come from one parent, the clone is a genetic copy of its parent.\\
10. Asexual reproduction enables organisms to reproduce without a(n) {mate}.\\
11. Asexual reproduction also enables some organisms to rapidly produce a large number of {offspring}.\\
12. Asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to each other and to their parent. This results in little genetic {variation} within a population.\\
13. Genetic variation is important because it can increase an organism's chance of {surviving} if the environment changes.\\
14. Genetic changes, called {mutations}, can occur and then be passed to offspring; this can affect the offspring's ability to survive.
