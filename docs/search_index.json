What is sexual reproduction? 1. Sexual reproduction produces an offspring when genetic materials from two different sex cells combine. a. The female sex cell, a(n) egg, forms in an ovary. b. The male sex cell, a(n) sperm, forms in a testis. 2. During a process called fertilization, an egg cell and a sperm cell join together. The new cell that forms is called a(n) zygote. B. Diploid Cells 1. Organisms that reproduce sexually make two kinds of cells—body cells and sex cells. 2. Body cells are diploid; they have pairs of chromosomes. 3. If a zygote has too many or too few chromosomes, it will not develop properly. 4. Different organisms have different numbers of chromosomes. 5. Homologous chromosomes are pairs of chromosomes that have genes for the same traits arranged in the same order. C. Haploid Cells 1. Sex cells are haploid; they have only one chromosome from each pair of chromosomes. 2. In meiosis, one diploid cell divides and makes four haploid cells. 3.1.3 Homework Matching 1. G 2. B 3. H 4.

A zygote is a new cell that forms when an egg cell and a sperm cell join during fertilization. (Hint: Check “how to write a definition” in extension) s 14. A diploid cell has pairs of chromosomes and is located in body cells. A haploid cell has only one set of chromosomes and is located in sex cells. (Hint: a pair or chromosomes/two sets of chromosomes vs. one chromosome from each pair/one set of chromsomes) 3.1.4 Extension How to write a definition? A formal definition is based upon a concise, logical pattern that includes as much information as it can within a minimum amount of space. The primary reason to include definitions in your writing is to avoid misunderstanding with your audience. A formal definition consists of three parts: The term (word or phrase) to be defined The class of object or concept to which the term belongs The differentiating characteristics that distinguish it from all others of its class For example: Water (term) is a liquid (class) made up of molecules of hydrogen and oxygen in the ratio of 2 to 1 (differentiating characteristics). Comic books (term) are sequential and narrative publications (class) consisting of illustrations, captions, dialogue balloons, and often focus on super-powered heroes (differentiating characteristics). Astronomy (term) is a branch of scientific study (class) primarily concerned with celestial objects inside and outside of the earth’s atmosphere (differentiating characteristics).

The Phases of Meiosis 1. Meiosis involves two divisions of the nucleus and the cytoplasm. These divisions, known as meiosis I and meiosis II, result in four haploid cells. 2. During interphase, the reproductive cell grows and duplicates its chromosomes. 3. During meiosis I, each pair of duplicated homologous chromosomes separates. 4. After meiosis I, the two cells formed during this stage go through a second division of the nucleus and cytoplasm called meiosis II. During meiosis II, sister chromatids separate to produce four haploid cells. E. Why is meiosis important? 1. Meiosis forms sex cells with the correct haploid number of chromosomes. This maintains the correct diploid number of chromosomes in organisms when sex cells join. Meiosis creates genetic variation by producing haploid cells. 3.2.2 Homework Fill in the Blanks 1. diploid; haploid 2. haploid; diploid 3. diploid 4. homologous chromosomes 5. homologous chromosomes 6.

During mitosis and cell division, a body cell and its nucleus divide once and produce two identical cells. 2. During meiosis, a reproductive cell and its nucleus divide twice and produce four cells––two pairs of identical haploid cells. G. Advantages of Sexual Reproduction 1. Sexual reproduction produces offspring that have a new combination of DNA. This results in genetic variation among individuals. 2. Genetic variation gives individuals within a population slight differences that might be an advantage if the environment changes. 3. Selective breeding has been used to develop desirable traits in plants and animals. H. Disadvantages of Sexual Reproduction 1. One disadvantage of sexual reproduction is that organisms have to grow and develop until they are mature enough to produce sex cells. 2. Another disadvantage is that searching for a mate takes time and energy and might expose individuals to predators, diseases, or harsh environmental conditions. Compare and contrast meiosis and mitosis and cell division Explain why genetic variation and selective breeding are advantages of sexual reproduction. Genetic variation: Instead of being exact genetic copies of parents, members of the same species have different traits, which enable some of them to survive environmental changes. Selective breeding: The process of choosing and breeding individuals with desirable traits allows breeders to create offspring with those traits. Identify two main disadvantages of sexual reproduction. 1. takes time and takes energy 2. sexual reproduction is limited by certain factors (For example, fertilization cannot take place during pregnancy, which can last as long as two years in some mammals.) Explain how the process of meiosis relates to the way in which a child resembles but is not an exact copy of his or her parents. Observable characteristics in a child, such as eye color, hair type and color, the shapes of facial features, and height, resemble those of his or her parents, because the child inherits portions of DNA from each parent. A child is not a exact copy of his or her parents because the child does not carry identical DNA to either parent.
